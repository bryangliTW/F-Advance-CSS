        <h2>Poem 1: Going There</h2>
        <p>Of course it was a disaster.
          That unbearable, dearest secret
          has always been a disaster.
          The danger when we try to leave.
          Going over and over afterward
          what we should have done
          instead of what we did.
          But for those short times
          we seemed to be alive. Misled,
          misused, lied to and cheated,
          certainly. Still, for that
          little while, we visited
          our possible life.</p>

      <h2>Poem 2: Girls Overheard While Assembling a Puzzle</h2>
      <p>
        Are you sure this blue is the same as the
        blue over there? This wall’s like the
        bottom of a pool, its
        color I mean. I need a
        darker two-piece this summer, the kind with
        elastic at the waist so it actually
        fits. I can’t
        find her hands. Where does this gold
        go? It’s like the angel’s giving
        her a little piece of honeycomb to eat.
        I don’t see why God doesn’t
        just come down and
        kiss her himself. This is the red of that
        lipstick we saw at the
        mall. This piece of her
        neck could fit into the light part
        of the sky. I think this is a
        piece of water. What kind of
        queen? You mean
        right here? And are we supposed to believe
        she can suddenly
        talk angel? Who thought this stuff
        up? I wish I had a
        velvet bikini. That flower’s the color of the
        veins in my grandmother’s hands. I
        wish we could
        walk into that garden and pick an
        X-ray to float on.
        Yeah. I do too. I’d say a
        zillion yeses to anyone for that.

        <h2>Poem 3: the ISM</h2>
        <p>
          tired i count the ways in which it determines my life
          permeates everything. it's in the air
          lives next door to me in stares of neighbors
          meets me each day in the office. its music comes out the radio
          drives beside me in my car. strolls along with me
          down supermarket aisles
          it's on television
          and in the streets even when my walk is casual/undefined
          it's overhead flashing lights
          i find it in my mouth
          when i would speak of other things
